            <p class = "text-center">All I do is sleep all day. As the bamboo has a low nutritional value, the Giant Panda has to spend a lot of time eating, and that is why their sleeping time cannot be too long. They sleep for 2-3 hours at a time, and then spend 3-4 hours eating. This sleeping mode can sustain a stable energy intake, and explains why they sleep right after they are full and eat right after they are awake, just like they do in a zoo.</p>

              <p class="text-center"> Scientists at China's Institute of Zoology found that giant pandas are able to survive on a diet of bamboo by only expending 38 percent of the energy typical for animals of their size</p>

              <p class="text-center">Researchers tracked the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of five captive and three wild giant pandas, and found the creatures don't move around much. The giant pandas' energy measurements "are among the lowest, relative to body mass, ever made" for mammals not in torpor, which is sort of like suspended animation, the authors write.</p>
